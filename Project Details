# Project details

  By using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit, 
it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. 
These types of devices are part of the quantified self movement – a group of enthusiasts who regularly 
take measurements about themselves to improve their health, find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. 
People regularly quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. 
In this project, your goal will be to use data acquired from accelerometers placed on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbbells of 6 participants. 
They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.

please cite the corresponding references as this data has been generously provided for use for this kind of assignment. 
The goal of your project is to predict how they did the exercise. This is called the “classe” variable in the training set.
